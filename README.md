## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
Before this project, I didn't know how to use google fonts in my projects, but I'm glad that I do now.
this project forced me to learn how to search,curate and import google fonts in my projects.

I also learnt how to make a site responsive, in the past, I had faced major difficulty in trying to make my sites responsive to different screen sizes. this project gave me the push i needed to force myself to not only learn, but to also impliment the CSSmediaquery in my projects.


### Continued development

I look forward to building more projects that require me to use flexbox, grid and mediaquerry.

I'd recommend it to anyone still finding in difficult to make their projects responsive.
